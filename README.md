This is an auditing platform for UPS safety. 

The audits are conducted through Team monitoring. Counting incidents per event. As such multiple counters are implemented to directly mirror operational paperwork. 

Every data value is stored in redux and handled through action generators. 



The application utilizes React, Redux, Redux-Persist, Firebase Auth and Firestore. 

All forms are route protected and further protected by firebase rules. 


When completed it will generate emails with document information. Create new rows to spreadsheets. And the data points will show trends and recommend safety outreach and focuses for UPS CHSP and CERT teams. Moreover the data will track team progress over time.
